I Want My Tears Back
I Want My Tears Back

The treetops' the chimneys'

The snowbed stories' winter grey
Wildflowers' those meadows of heaven'
Wind in the wheat

A railroad across waters'
The scent of grandfatherly love
Blue bayous' Decembers'
Moon through a dragonfly's wings
Where is the wonder? where's the awe?

Where's dear Alice knocking on the door?
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there?
Where the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare?
Where is the wonder? where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me

I Want My Tears Back!

I Want My Tears Back Now!

A ballet on a grove'
Still growing young all alone

A rag doll' a best friend'
The voice of Mary Costa
Where is the wonder? where's the awe?
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door?
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there?
Where the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare?
Where is the wonder? where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me

Where is the wonder? where's the awe?

Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me

I Want My Tears Back!

I Want My Tears Back Now!

Where is the wonder? where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
Where is the wonder? where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the Lost in Me!

I Want My Tears Back!

I Want My Tears Back Now!
