You Know I still Love You Baby
And it will never change
(Saranghae)

I want nobody nobody But You
I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody

Why are you trying to
to make me leave ya
I know what you're thinking
Baby why aren't you listening
How can I just Just love someone else and
Forget you completely
When I know you still love me

Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know it's not right so
Just stop and come back boy
How can this be When we were meant to be

I want nobody nobody But You
I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody

I want nobody nobody But You
I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody

Why can't we just just be like this cause
it's you that I need and nothing else until the end
Who else can ever make me feel the way I
I feel when I'm with you no one will ever do

Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know me enough so
you know what I need boy
Right next to you is where I need to be

I want nobody nobody But You
I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody

I want nobody nobody But You
I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody

I don't want no body body
I don't want no body body
Honey you know it's you that I want
It's you that I need Why can't you see~

I want nobody nobody But You

How can I be with another I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody

I want nobody nobody But You
I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another I don't want any other

Back to the days when we were so young and wild and free
Nothing else matters other than you and me
so tell me why can't it be
please let me live my life my way
why do you push me away
I don't want nobody nobody nobody nobody but you
